        <h2 class="heading-secondary-faq">Why hire a personal trainer?</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="faq-p">
        When you think about investments, you might not be thinking about
        investing in your health. However, hiring a personal trainer is just
        that - an investment in your health and longevity. Beyond the
        investment, there are many reasons to hire a personal trainer that
        extend beyond your age, gender, or physical abilities. These are
        universal truths about the role of a personal trainer in your physical
        and nutritional health.

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary-faq">Partnership of Accountability</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="faq-p">
        A personal trainer has the responsibility to help you reach your fitness
        and nutrition goals. There are two roles of accountability in this
        relationship. First, you as a client have the job to take your trainer's
        adviceand work towards achieving our goals. However, personal trainer
        has the responsibility of creating a program that meets both your
        physical needs and your goals in strength and weight. It is this
        professional relationship of shared accountability that helps you stay
        on track. It is a lot harder to miss a workout and take too many 'cheat
        days' in a row when you have someone who has dedicated time and is
        willing to help push you out of your comfort zone.
      </p>
      <div class="u-center-text u-margin-bottom-small u-margin-top-small">
        <h3 class="heading-tertiary-faq">Expertise and Personalization</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="faq-p">
        A personal trainer will customize your workout based on your personal
        goals, strengths, and even your weaknesses. Trainers understand that
        everybody has different histories, injuries, and bodies. We specialize
        in offering modifications and progressions thatgive you a challenging
        workout for your unique body. The personal and personal trainer is there
        for a reason. Our job isn't just to cheer you on - we design workouts
        that meet your goals. Also, you can rest assured knowing that we will
        correct your form because proper form means you're working out
        efficiently. Also, when using the correct form, you are targeting the
        muscle you hope to work. Therefore, having a personal trainer's
        expertise will help ensure your workout is effective and gets you the
        results you want rather than spinning your wheels and not making your
        gains.

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary-faq">Gym Intimidation</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="faq-p">
        One of the reasons people do not enter the gym or stick with a program
        is because of intimidation. There is a lot of equipment in the gym, and
        there are many people who seem to know what they are doing. It is often
        challenging for a newbie to walk into the gym and start working out.
        When this happens, often new gym-goers will stick to what they know, and
        often what they know does not lead to the realization of their long-term
        goals. Because of this, visits to the gym become more and more
        infrequent. However, a personal trainer is going to guide you through
        the gym beyond just a tour. You will learn and become confident about
        what each piece of equipment does, how to use it, and why the equipment
        will lead you to your long-term goals.
      </p>

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary-faq">Minimizing Injury</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="faq-p u-margin-bottom-medium">
        An injury can undoubtedly derail your fitness efforts, and some injuries
        are preventable. A poorly constructed workout routine can increase the
        possibility of an injury. Also, once you become injured, it's
        challenging to get back on track again. A personal trainer will guide
        you on how to use gym equipment correctly to help prevent injuries.
        Plus, as mentioned already, your physical form and posture while
        performing an exercise make a difference with both the movement's
        effectiveness and your likelihood of getting hurt. Improper form and
        posture can lead to injuries as much as improper use of equipment. A
        personal trainer is educated on all aspects of form, gym equipment, and
        can guide clients to make the most of their workout safely.
